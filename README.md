# Deepfake Detection Using AI

Bachelor thesis project (BSc, DTU) on detecting deepfake images using deep learning.  
The project focuses on classifying static facial images as **real** or **fake** with AI models.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
Deepfake technology is rapidly evolving, making fake images harder to detect.  
This project explores several approaches for image-based detection:
- A **Custom CNN** built from scratch as a baseline.
- Fine-tuned **XceptionNet**.
- Fine-tuned **EfficientNet-B0**.

The dataset was derived from **FaceForensics++**, extracting and balancing real vs. fake images:
- **Train:** 8,000 real + 8,000 fake  
- **Test:** 2,000 real + 2,000 fake  

### Key Results
- Custom CNN â†’ **79% accuracy**  
- EfficientNet-B0 â†’ **96.6% accuracy**  
- XceptionNet â†’ **98.1% accuracy (best model)**  

Additional evaluation included:
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Confusion matrices  
- Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/deepfake-detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection
   ````` 

2.	Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ````` 
4.	Run training (example for custom CNN):
    ```bash
    python src/train_custom_cnn.py
    ````` 

6.	Evaluate a trained model:
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate_custom_cnn.
    `````
    
## ðŸ“Š Results (Summary)

| Model        | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Custom CNN   | 81.2%               | 79.3%         |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 96.6%            | 96.6%         |
| XceptionNet  | 98.1%               | 98.0%         |

Grad-CAM examples show that both XceptionNet and EfficientNet focus on subtle facial regions when detecting manipulations.

## ðŸ”® Future Work
- Extend detection to **video-based** deepfakes.  
- Train **deeper custom CNNs** with longer training schedules.  
- Use larger and more diverse datasets (e.g., **DFDC**, **Celeb-DF**).
